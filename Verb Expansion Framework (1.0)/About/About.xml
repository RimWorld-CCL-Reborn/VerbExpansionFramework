	This Framework implements a number of improvements to the handling of attack verbs in RimWorld.
	- Animals will now recognize and use ranged attack verbs.
	- Pawns will recognize and use anged attack verbs that are provided through hediffs.
	- The chooseRangedVerb function will allow non-colonist pawns to automatically select the most effective ranged verb from all of the ranged verbs that they posses.
	- The current weapon button has been changed. Now it shows the currently assigned verb, be that from a weapon, weapon attachment, race definition or hediff. Clicking on it will now bring up a text list of all available ranged verbs, so that you can choose which one they will use.
	
	More enhancements to verbs are expected to follow, such as smoke-pop-belts and shield belts for animals and mechanoids, verbs with a cooldown period and much more besides.
	
	This is intended as a re-implementation of the RangedAnimalFramework for 1.0, with new, more powerful features and greater compatibility.
